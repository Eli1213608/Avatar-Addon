India faces particullary unique challenges due to its large population, rapid urbanization, and the globalized nature of its healthcare & and pharama system. India is one of the world's largest consumers and producers of antibiotics. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, and antibiotics are widely prescribed and often easily available without proper regulation. This contributes to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to the development and spread of resistant bacteria. Addittionaly, India is the center of medical toursim, cheap healthcare, and a government that imposes fewer regulations.


Globalization has made it challenging to establish consistent regulations for antibiotics globally
